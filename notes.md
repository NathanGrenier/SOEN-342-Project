re: Project use cases: Process Offering would normally entail the creation of an offering (and similarly for Process Booking) which is a critical requirement. You would have to define additional (non-critical) use cases to fully support the requirements such as Cancel Offering (and Cancel Booking). My suggestion is not to encapsulate everything about offerings (or bookings) in a single use case.
